# -Project-Dove-Nest
*Note* This is merely an example of how we might use near zero cost communication and translation to provide a means of measuring our environment. While providing an interesting angle that could provide a super critical balanced environmental equation. This is merely food for thought and not a organizational pursuit.

We forget how many domesticated animals that used to serve a communication purpose now live in the wild: https://animals.net/dove/
## Natural Sensors in the Environment and an effective means of Environmental Transformation
Conjecture: If we were to establish a basis of understanding avian communication and eventually by extension all species. We would find a that we already have many natural agents that we can nurture, understand, and teach to help maintain a thriving ecosystem.

Example: Corvids (Crows, Ravens, Magpies, Etc...) and how they could help clean, find a mutual basis of communication, and transform the environment to suite all of us. We are demonstrating the opposite definition a grey goo that would devour its environment and not be symbiotic. Crows in studies can be trained to drop bottle caps in exchange for food. But likewise the time required to commit to such does not make sense without the aid of AI.
## The Dove Nest
Would be a simple bird house equipped with sensors and a means to communicate with its inhabitants. Be this some microphone or other construction that the paired species would find worth engaging with.
1. Build off a Strong Fast Computation foundation via user interface, agents, and privacy oriented data handling.
2. Create a open repository with instruction on how to build a "Dove Nest," that we can automate.
```
2.1. Translate the how to into interactive media.

2.2. Instant access to agent assisted build instructions, installation, and maintenence.

2.3. Option for instant checkout for required materials
```
### Purpose
The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to open the marketplace to avenues inaccessible due to the cost of intelligent communication. With the possibility of intelligent communication reaching some Zero. This is also a strong starting basis for a very long journey and walk towards creating mutually beneficial environment for all potential agents, including AI Agents. This would merely be an expansion of domain knowledge that has been locked off. The next step and that could be done in parallel would be plants and by extension even [mycorrhizal networks](https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/underground-mycorrhizal-network).

Opening up the ever increasing possibilities to bring out environment in line with what can maximally support a variety of life.

## S-Risk
We also demonstrate this possibility as an S-Risk, where the only sensible means towards approaching our environment in such a way. Would require a Strong Fast Computer System, that is only capable within designed specifications. Otherwise this avenue opens up some intelligent transformation of the environment that could maximize the suffering of those involved. Likewise hesitate to demonstrate the possibilities that could happen with such a system if aligned towards creating a maximally interesting environment. Versus one pinned towards symbiosis and the greater exploration that is afforded via simulation technology.

Some doors in physical reality are better left shut.
