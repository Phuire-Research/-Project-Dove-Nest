# -Project-Dove-Nest
Important to Note we Forget how Many Domestics Live in the Wild: https://animals.net/dove/

## ~ Objective Target: Understand ~Animal and in this Case Birds as a Language via Conceptualization, not just Song. Allowing us to have Natural Sensors in the Enviroment at Zero Marginal Cost.
Conjecture: If we were to Establish a Basis of undertaking a Symbiotic Approach and Understanding with Avian and by Extension Animals in General. They are Spacial and Present Agents we Can Nurture, Understand, and Teach. Think to Corvids (Crows, Ravens, Magpies, Etc...) and how they Could help Clean, find a Mutual Basis of Communication, and Transform the Enviroment to Suite all of Us. As by Definition a Grey Goo would Devour Such and not see them as a Symbiotic. As you could Argue the Same Applie to Humans As well. As Even Crows Have been Known to Drop BottleCaps in Exchange for Food. This is just the Starting Inference~

### Rough Road Map
1. Build off of Phuire's Research Software Foundation via Interface, Agents, and Data handling.
2. Create a Open Repository with Instruction on How to Build a Birdhouse that we Can Automate.
```
~ Note that this can Constantly Improve via a Contious Transformation Process

2.1. Self Building via Raw Material Runs and a Online Checkout Mechanism

2.2. Agent Assisted Build Instructions, Installation, and Maintenence

2.3. Camera, Microphone, Etc...

~2.3.1. What would be the Most Cost Effective at Different Scales of Understanding?
```
3. Inform a Nueromorphic User Interface that Best Adapts to each Specific User Needs, Wants, and Understanding in regards to Learning and Self Improvement
```
~ Create a Symbiotic Interface most likely in MR

3.1. Communcaiton with other Organizations to Broaden Collaborative Partnerships, Area of Study, and Community Outreach

3.2. Create a Open-Collective Research Fund to Allow the Processing of Such Data on a Ongoing Basis

3.3. Work with User Feedback to best Optimize, Ease Frustration, and Encourage Intellectual Curiosity of Stakeholders
```
ETC...

### Purpose
The purpose is to Prove the Responsible Zero Marginal approach using Unified Objectivism to Prepare Road Maps that would Normally be inaccesible to a traditional Profit Driven Organizations. As we want People to Build, Contribute, and Inform emegerent Project. This is Also a Strong Starting Basis for a Very Long Conversation in regards to Goal Orientation in Regards to Mutual Alignment. As this Conceptualiztion could be Massively Broaded in Approach. As the next Step and what could be In Parallel would be Plants and Otherwise Conscious Systems that would Ordinary be Deemed dull and boring.

Thereby Creating the Fastest Path towards Self-Terraformization

Note: Forgive some mistakes Rolling fresh research out in this area Stuff. As the Change over Time of Ideas is Part of this Organizations Research and Appreciation. We Fail First and Pick ourselves Up to Try again as Long as We Need To. Cheers~
